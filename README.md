Source Control Diff EngineA file comparison tool built in Python that implements the edit distance algorithm from scratch. This project explores dynamic programming to find the minimum-cost sequence of edits (insertions, deletions, and replacements) required to transform one file into another.The tool generates a human-readable diff log detailing the precise operations needed to change File A into File B, inspired by the functionality of git diff.About This ProjectThis project began as an exploration of edit distance, starting with a basic recursive implementation and evolving into a highly efficient, bottom-up dynamic programming solution.The central feature is a two-stage diff algorithm optimized for comparing source code and text files:Phase 1: Line-Level ComparisonThe tool first runs the edit distance algorithm on the files line-by-line. This quickly identifies which lines are identical, added, deleted, or changed.Phase 2: Character-Level RefinementFor any lines identified as changed, the tool performs a second pass of the edit distance algorithm only on that specific pair of lines.This two-stage approach is dramatically more efficient than a naive character-by-character comparison, as it focuses computational effort only on the parts of the file that have actually changed.Implementations IncludedThis repository contains the full evolution of the algorithm:Naive Recursive: A simple, top-down recursive implementation that mirrors the mathematical definition.Bottom-Up DP: The efficient $O(mn)$ iterative dynamic programming solution that uses a cost matrix to avoid redundant computations.Optimized Two-Stage Engine: The final, practical tool that performs the two-stage comparison to generate a clean and accurate list of edit operations.
